# Stock-market-prediction

Our team’s project idea came largely from the efficient- market hypothesis that states: “ share prices
reflect all information”, which is to mean that newly revealed information about a company obtained
through news outlets will directly impact that company’s stock price. As a result, we found it intriguing to
monitor stock price movement from specific pieces of news releases.
We focused on analyzing a series of company’s earnings-related news to predict the direction of stock
price movement and ultimately develop investment strategies by leveraging our predictive capabilities on
`
stock movement. Our tool is geared towards helping institutional portfolio managers by granting essential
earnings news on specific companies in a matter of minutes.
Our project rests on three main pillars to deliver on an outcome. Upon gathering the news items and
snippets that pertain to a company’s earnings, we then integrate Natural Language Processing techniques
to determine the sentiment of the text. Once the sentiment is determined, we can make predictions on
the direction of the stock market movement. Lastly, our outcome is to use the predictions along with our
investment strategies and apply them to the market to generate profits.
